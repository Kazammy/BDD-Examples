# BDD-Examples
example of BDD (Behavior Driven Development

## List of main BDD frameworks in Java World
I am taking in account only the frameworks based on Java language. 

* Cucumber-jvm
* JBehave
* Concordion
* JGiven
* Serenity BDD

## Cucumber-jvm
Cucumber can be consider as the reference framework for BDD.
Cucumber is not limited in Java but exists in a lot of language.
The java version is called Cucumber-jvm.

Cucumber-jvm works both with JUnit and TestNG. But to configure it with TestNG is quite difficult.



## Frameworks comparison
